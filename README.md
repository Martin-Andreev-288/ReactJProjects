# ReactJProjects

## Important info
This repository contains different projects, each organized into separate folder, which I built as part of following the John Smilga React course on Udemy.

I want to clarify that I do not claim ownership of the project ideas or concepts. These projects were created for educational purposes only, following the course structure, and are intended to help me practice and learn various technologies and frameworks.

Throughout these projects, I practiced:

  - React (core concepts and advanced features)
  - TypeScript with React
  - Redux for state management
  - HTML & CSS
  - Tailwind CSS
  - React Query for data fetching
  - Working with API keys

The repository is not intended for commercial use, but rather to document my learning journey. All credit for the original project ideas goes to John Smilga and his Udemy course.

## How to Run each Project
 - Open the chosen project folder;
 - Run npm install;
 - Run npm run dev (or npm start ONLY for the project in folder 15comfy-store).

## Original Course
These projects are based on the course by John Smilga: [Complete React, Next.js & TypeScript Projects Course 2024](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-tutorial-and-projects-course).
